A great way to demonstrate responsive breakpointa inside of a styleguide with iframes and angularJs

Sometimes there's a need to demonstrate inside of a styleguide what components (menus, tabs, navs, etc...) look like at different breakpoints. This is a technique that uses iframes embedded within an example styleguide. The demo uses AngularJS, Angular Material and is optimized for apple iphone and ipad devices at their screen dimensions.
